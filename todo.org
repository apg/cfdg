* General
  - refactor primitives
    - [X] circle
    - [X] square
    - [X] rect
    - [X] line
  - Contracts
  - Normalize on context names
  - Probabilistic routes (duplicate top level define right now)

* Starting context params
  - [ ] output filename (potentially take as command line arg, or new parameter?)
  - [X] Width, Height
  - [X] Initial X, Y
  - [X] Nesting
  - [X] Initial Hue, Saturation, Luminance

* Enhancements
  - [ ] Support absolute context adjustments, and potentially function calls for adjustments.
  - [ ] Could in theory define our own functions to call for context updates as well.
  - [ ] It is an error for `rule` to attempt to expand a parameter that is not valid in rule context.

* CFDG parser / compiler
  - [ ] Potentially do multiple passes to optimally order, to avoid undefined errors.
  - [ ] Ensure only one start-rule

* Add todo list
  - [X] Remove top level checkboxes

* Examples
  - [ ] examples/ directory, port some over.
